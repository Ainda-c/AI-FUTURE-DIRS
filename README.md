# AI Future Directions: Edge, Ethics, and Quantum 🚀

This project explores the future of Artificial Intelligence across three transformative themes:

- **Edge AI**: Lightweight machine learning models deployed on edge devices.  
- **Ethical AI**: Assessment of algorithmic bias in critical sectors like medicine and governance.  
- **Quantum AI**: Early simulations of AI optimization using quantum computing.

The repository combines models, case studies, theoretical analysis, technical design, and visual presentations—geared toward ethical and practical AI integration in future systems.
